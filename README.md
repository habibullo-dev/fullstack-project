Project Name: MedKorea

About
MedKorea is a comprehensive platform dedicated to providing reliable and comprehensive information about English-speaking medical professionals and facilities in South Korea. Our goal is to make healthcare more accessible and less stressful for foreigners visiting or living in South Korea. Whether you are a tourist, student, or expat, finding quality healthcare in a new country can be challenging, especially if there is a language barrier. We are here to help bridge that gap by providing:

A landing page for users to get an overview of our services.
A search page for finding doctors and facilities.
A registration page for creating a user account.
A booking appointment page for scheduling medical appointments.
A user dashboard page for managing appointments and account settings.
An admin page for handling administrative tasks.
An about page for providing information about our platform and mission.


Our project utilizes the following technologies:


Frontend Language: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend Language: Python

Server-side Rendering: Python with Flask

Database Management System: MariaDB

Database Connection: pymysql

ORM: SQLAlchemy

SQL Language: Used for querying the database

Python with Flask is used for server-side rendering, providing dynamic content to the users. pymysql is used to connect to the MariaDB database. SQLAlchemy is used as an ORM to interact with the database. SQL language is employed for querying the database, and PHPMyAdmin serves as an administration interface for visual aid in database management.
